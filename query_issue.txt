WITH the_dates AS (
    SELECT date_trunc('day', dd)::date AS the_date
    FROM generate_series('2023-04-29'::date, '2028-04-29'::date, '1 month'::interval) dd
)
SELECT td.the_date AS date
FROM the_dates td;

The problem above is the first non-leap year it reaches (ie, 2025-02-28) changes the day of the month for all subsequent records to 28 instead of 29
